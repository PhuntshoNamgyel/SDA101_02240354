# Main Concepts Applied

1. Responsive Design: Implemented Tailwind CSS classes to ensure adaptability across various screen sizes, utilizing classes like md:p-6 and md:text-4xl to change padding and text size for larger screens.

2. Micro Interaction: Added an interactive button with a scale effect and color transition using Tailwind CSS, enhancing user engagement by subtly changing on hover with hover:bg-green-700 and hover:scale-105.

3. Minimalism: Focused on a clean, accessible layout with a simple color palette, providing an easy and intuitive user experience.

# Reflection
## What I Learned

1. Enhanced Styling Control: Using Tailwind, I gained more control over responsive design without needing external media queries, which streamlined the development process.

2. Interactivity through CSS Transitions: Implemented engaging micro-interactions directly in HTML, making it easy to add animations that contribute to user experience.


## Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them
